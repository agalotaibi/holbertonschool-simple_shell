.SH NAME
simple_shell - minimal UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.br
.B echo "command" | ./hsh
.br
.B ./hsh < script.txt

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a small UNIX command interpreter that reads and executes
commands from standard input or from a file. It provides a lightweight
execution environment suitable for educational and embedded use while
maintaining the expected behavior of a basic UNIX shell.

.SH MODES OF OPERATION

.SS Interactive Mode
When standard input is connected to a terminal (isatty returns true),
the shell runs interactively. A command prompt:

.RS
$
.RE

is displayed before each command.

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
When standard input is not a terminal, the shell reads commands until EOF
and executes them sequentially without displaying a prompt. This mode works
with pipes:

.RS
$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
.RE

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
For each command, the shell performs the following steps:

.RS
1. Read a line of input.
.br
2. Split the line into tokens using whitespace.
.br
3. Treat the first token as the command name and the rest as arguments.
.br
4. If the command is built-in, execute it internally.
.br
5. Otherwise, search for the command in the PATH directories.
.br
6. If found, fork a new process and execute it using execve.
.br
7. Wait for the child process to finish and record its exit status.
.RE

If the command cannot be found, the shell prints an error and returns exit status 127.
If the command is found but cannot be executed, it returns exit status 126.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS

.SS exit
.B exit [status]
.RS
Terminate the shell.
.br
If a status is provided, the shell exits with that value.
.br
If no status is provided, the exit code of the last executed command is used.
.RE

.SS env
.B env
.RS
Display the current environment variables in NAME=VALUE format.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell inherits its environment from its parent process. Programs executed
with execve receive the same environment unless modified by the program.

.SH SIGNALS
In interactive mode, the shell ignores SIGINT (Ctrl+C) to avoid terminating
itself, but child processes still receive the signal.
.br
Pressing Ctrl+D sends an EOF, which terminates the shell.

.SH LIMITATIONS
This implementation intentionally omits advanced shell features:

.RS
- No pipelines
.br
- No redirection
.br
- No command separators (;, &&, ||)
.br
- No grouping
.br
- No variable expansion
.br
- No wildcard expansion
.br
- No scripting support
.br
- No comments
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell exits with the following values:

.RS
0   - Successful termination
.br
126 - Command found but not executable
.br
127 - Command not found
.br
Otherwise, the exit status is that of the last executed command.
